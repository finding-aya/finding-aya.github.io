  <h1>About Me 🌸</h1>
  <p>Hello! I'm Aya.
    I've been learning English for 2 years now.

    Thank you for joining me on my language learning journey!

While I usually teach myself, my friends from real life and HelloTalk have been incredibly supportive and witty.

    
🎶 I enjoy a wide range of music, including punk rock, melodic death metal, ska, and many other genres.🎶

🌍 I'm from the Kansai area and I'm 170cm tall. 🌍

🌈I'm happy to chat with you all🎉 </p>
